			<p>One of the first things I did at Hobie Cat is take stock of current assets. by first interviewing our product managers, product designers and engineers. In collaboration with various departments, the website has evolved. We begin with the creative brief. For many projects, this is a succinct document outlining the scope and deliverables of the project. The Hobie Livewell XL required nothing more than a one-page illustrated wireframe of sorts to develop the layout and photography art direction.</p>

		<div class="col-6 columns">
			<p>I am involved in the process from concept to completion acting in various roles from project manager, art director and lead front-end designer. Each project typically involves working with a small team to execute the various stages of development. This includes working with our industrial designers, engineers and product managers to develop the project scope.</p>
